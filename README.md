# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic they do *not* have to
be completely connected. I have started with the formal definition of
isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

## Proof:

Consider the graph $H$ with two vertices $A$ and $B$ that do not have an edge between them this graph is not completely connected. $H$ is isomorphic to itself even though it is not completely connected. Therefore, two graphs can be isomorphic to eachother without being completely connected.
